<h1>Workshop 3: JavaScript Events</h1>
<hr />
<p>In this exercise we will practice the use of BOM and the JavaScript events. Use the lecture-material as a reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a 
good idea to save the lines of code you write during the exercises for later use.</p>

<H2>Exercise 6</h2>
<button>Get location</button> 
<button>Show location</button> 

<li>The first button should check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp">Geolocation</a> of the user, and output it to the console and to the 
page. Note: Some browsers might not allow you to do this. Try different browsers if you get errors.</li>
<li>
The second button should show your location on a Google Maps. You can see the map with a spesific location using the URL 
"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center="+latlon+"&zoom=14&size=400x300&sensor=false" where latlon is your latitude + longitute data separated by 
comma (,).
</li>
