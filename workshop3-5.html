<h1>Workshop 3: JavaScript Events</h1>
<hr />
<p>In this exercise we will practice the use of BOM and the JavaScript events. Use the lecture-material as a reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a 
good idea to save the lines of code you write during the exercises for later use.</p>


<h2>Exercise 5</h2>

<div id="coordinates"></div>

<p>Add onMouseMove -event to the DIV-element above. When you move mouse over the DIV (rectangle) the program should output the coordinates of your pointer. Try first 
outputting to the console using console.log. <p>HINT. When the event occurs, call for a method showXY(event); Then in the actual method you can output data from the 
mouse event using event.clientX and event.clientY variables. Study the event object in the console  and what data you can find in it.</p>
<p> When the program is working, you can try outputting the text on the H2 element with an id "coords" the box</p> HINT: You need to use 
document.getElementById("coordinates").innerHTML to achieve this.
