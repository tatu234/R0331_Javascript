<h1>Workshop 3: JavaScript Events</h1>
<hr />
<p>In this exercise we will practice the use of BOM and the JavaScript events. Use the lecture-material as a reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a 
good idea to save the lines of code you write during the exercises for later use.</p>

<h2>Exercise 4</h2>
So far you have hardcoded the events into HTML tags. Make a copy of your exercise file and try to add the events dynamically, without touching the HTML at all. This can be 
achieved using addEventListener() -function, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp"> see more here</a>.
