<h1>Workshop 3: JavaScript Events</h1>
<hr />
<p>In this exercise we will practice the use of BOM and the JavaScript events. Use the lecture-material as a reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a 
good idea to save the lines of code you write during the exercises for later use.</p>



<h2 id="demo" onmouseover="mouseOver(alert('Stepped over by a mouse!'))" onmouseout="mouseOut(alert('Bye bye, mouse!'))">Exercise 2</h2>
<script>
  function mouseOver() {
    document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "green";
  }
  
  function mouseOut() {
    document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "black";
  }
  </script>
<ul>
  <li>Add an&nbsp;onMouseOver event on the&nbsp;Heading "Exercise 2" of this page.&nbsp;It should&nbsp;fire when the users mouse is moved
over&nbsp;it. Output "Stepped over my a mouse!" on the console.</li>
  <li>Add another event, which will fire then the mouse leaves the Exercise 2 -heading. This time show an alert window to the user saying: "Bye bye mouse!"</li>
</ul>
